# LLM Streamlit App

A simple and interactive **LLM-powered web application** built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Ollama**.  
This project demonstrates how to connect a **locally running Large Language Model (Llama 3.2 – 1B)** with a Python-based web interface for real-time prompt-based interaction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to:
- Enter text prompts through a clean Streamlit UI
- Send prompts to a **local LLM** running via Ollama
- Receive intelligent responses in real time

The project is designed to be **beginner-friendly**, lightweight, and a solid starting point for building more advanced LLM-based applications.
